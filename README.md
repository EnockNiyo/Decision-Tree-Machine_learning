# Decision Tree Algorithm for Machine Learning
## Description
This repository contains an implementation of a decision tree algorithm for machine learning purposes. Decision trees are a popular method for classification and regression tasks due to their simplicity and interpretability.
## Dataset 
the file called 
### music.cv 
So we use this above dataset to predict Kind of music people like based on their Age range 
## Features
Binary Decision Trees: The implementation supports binary decision trees for both classification and regression tasks.
Feature Selection: The algorithm includes methods for selecting the best features at each node of the tree.
Pruning: Optionally, the decision tree can be pruned to prevent overfitting.
